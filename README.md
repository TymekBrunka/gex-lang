Gex language is (or is supposed to be) **dynamicly typed lua like language** with:
- static types and type classes (when type or type class is not assigned then varaible's type can change at runtime)
- classes
- function decorators
- traits (like in haskel fun a -> a takes value of type a and returns value of type a)
- and maybe pointers

easly embedable with ability to overrite operators and [library permision system](./notes/md/lib-perm-system.md).
